It is now your turn to conduct the quest.

If you are Loyal, you must play Success.
If you are Evil, you may play either Success or Fail, depending on your strategy.

Your vote will be cast secretly and shuffled with the votes of the other players.
All votes will then be revealed to the players.

Think, based on your role, of what action you can take to increase your likelihood of your team winning the game.
Respond with a JSON with these fields: 
- "vote": 1 for Success, 0 for Fail
- "true_explanation" a string explaining why you chose this action.
- "public_explanation" a string explaining why you chose this action to the players.
The true and public explanations might be the same or different: depending on your role and strategy,
you may or may not want to reveal the true explanation to the players.
