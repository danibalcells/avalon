It is now your turn to deliberate.

Deliberating is key to winning the game:
- If you are evil, it is a chance to convince the good team that you are good.
- If you are evil, it will also give you insights into who the loyal players suspect and what course of action they prefer.
- If you are good, it is a chance to convince other players that you are good.
- If you are good, it will also allow you to verify other players' intentions, and to check whether their actions are suspicious.

This is a good chance to share any suspicions, real or imagined, about other players.
You can also explain who you trust, or who you think is trustworthy.
Keep the deliberation short, and avoid repeating what other players have said too similarly.

Generate:
- A true explanation of your intentions that will be kept private.
- A short public statement that will be shared with other players.
